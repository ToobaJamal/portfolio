          detail: `According to research from Matillon and IDG, data volumes increase by 63 percent per month on average in an organization. 
          Examining such substantial volumes of data without the right tools makes it impossible to make informed decisions, even in small businesses. 
          The key to deriving useful and profit-driving insights from data is data visualization - 
          which turns complex raw figures into meaningful visual representations of the data.`

          detail: `When you're first learning React, props are often one of the most difficult topics to understand – 
          especially when it comes to passing props across components. 
          And when you need similar props in more than one component, things can get really tricky.
          In this guide, we will start by understanding what props are and what they do. 
          We'll look at the different types of props, and how to use similar props in multiple components.`

          detail: `When I started learning to code, the term API would always haunt me. 
          I couldn't make sense of what it actually meant because I would hear people talking about APIs in different contexts.
          The biggest challenge was that I couldn't find resources to learn about APIs in simple terms.
          Now that I know how APIs work, I decided to write this guide for any newbies out there who are struggling 
          to make sense of this not-so-complicated but still confusing topic in web development and software engineering.`

          Backend developers have some powerful databases in their toolkit. But if you are a frontend developer, 
          you can still store and process data using web storage.
        In this article, you'll learn what is a web storage, the different types of web storage, and when to use each one of them.`
